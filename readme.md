_Lihan Chen, Xiaolin Zhou, Hermann J. Mueller, Zhuanghua Shi_

This resp hosts research data obtained in the study _What you see depends on what you hear: temporal rate averaging and crossmodal integration_. The experiments were run in Peking University by Dr. Chen. Data analysis codes and modelling were developed by Dr. Shi (LMU Munich, Germany). This project is supported by Natural Science Foundation of China (31200760, 61621136008, 61527804), and German DFG project SH166. 

## Raw behavioral data

The raw data are stored in `exp#.csv` files. 

Baseline data from Experiments 1 to 3 are stored in `meanResps.rds`. 


## Analysis code and modeling

`ana_functions.R` contains functions for data analysis, and `data_process.R` generates all figures and statistical tests, as well as the predictions from the Bayesian modelling.

Rmarkdown file `temporal_averaging.Rmd` compiles all results in one file.
